# MIRCV Search Engine 

In this project, a search engine was developed based on the MSMARCO Passages collection, which is available on https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/TREC-Deep-Learning-2020. The project consists of three main parts:

* **Inverted Index Creation**: the first part involves creating an inverted index structure from a set of text documents.


* **Query Processing**: the second part focuses on processing queries over the inverted index through a terminal interface.


* **Search Engine Evaluation**: the final part involves evaluating the search engine's performance using standard evaluation tool TrecEval.
